**Over 85 recipes to build modular, readable, and testable Golang applications across various domains**

## What is this book about?
Go (or Golang) is a statically typed programming language developed at Google. Known for its vast standard library, it also provides features such as garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capabilities, and additional built-in types. This book will serve as a reference while implementing Go features to build your own applications.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Work with third-party Go projects and modify them for your use 
* Write Go code using modern best practices 
* Manage your dependencies with the new Go module system 
* Solve common problems encountered when dealing with backend systems or DevOps 
* Explore the Go standard library and its uses 
Test, profile, and fine-tune Go applications

All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
                b, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r)
                if err != nil {
                    return "", err
                }
                return string(b), nil
        }
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is aimed for web developers, programmers, and enterprise developers. Basic knowledge of the Go language is assumed. Experience with backend application development is not necessary, but may help understand the motivation behind some of the recipes.

This book serves as a good reference for Go developers who are already proficient but need a quick reminder, example, or reference. With the open source repository, it should be possible to share these examples quickly with a team as well. If you are looking for quick solutions to common and not-so-common problems in Go programming, this book is for you.
